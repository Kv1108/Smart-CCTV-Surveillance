I'm getting married. Oh, my God. To who? This guy. He has a killer apartment. And. And it's on 5th. And the elevator opens up right into the living room. What's he like? Oh, he's okay. Do you remember my old boyfriend, Mark? Yeah, it's his dad. Sweetie, I gotta tell you, it sounds a little bit like you like the apartment more than you like Myron. Yeah, I told you he was old. Oh, honey. You know, I once also almost married somebody that I didn't love. Do you remember Barry? Remember him how we used to make out all the time after you went to sleep? Sometimes just nodding is okay, so. But anyway, listen, Amy, you. You deserve true love. Your. Your soulmate is out there somewhere. You're right. I'm. I'm gonna do it. Okay. I'm gonna marry Myron and keep looking for Mr. Right. Okay. Okay, let's keep talking.
